State-Wise Sentiment Analysis Of CAA, NRC &amp; NPR Tweets

“The Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and, National Register of Citizens act took the entire nation by storm. Be it due to the heated newsroom debates, or the protests and riots on the streets, the entire nation was talking about it. As the row over these acts brought thousands of Indians to the streets, caused nationwide controversies and protests, their state-wise analysis helped us better understand their impact across the nation.”

Twitter, being the one such popular social website contains an abundance of such data that can be processed in order to obtain meaningful results like sentiment scores, product reviews and  predictive analysis.

The main objective of this project is to use the twitter data to study the nation-wide opinion and views on CAA, NRC and NPR using sentiment analysis. Also termed as opinion mining, sentiment analysis is primarily used for analyzing the opinions and conversations of public and using this data to classify the sentiment as positive, negative or neutral.
